					<p>In July, 2015, we installed a partial dam across the River Whiteadder near Chirnside and spent three weeks excavating the river bed, collecting many fish, tetrapod, plant and arthropod fossils.  Getting permission to proceed was non-trivial, as the Whiteadder is a salmon river and we could only work for a short period during the summer, and had to make sure we put the site back as it had been once we'd finished.</p>
