					<p>Letting the public know what we are doing is an important aspect of the project. Most of this will be performed by the team at the NMS, Nick Fraser, Andy Ross and Stig Walsh, but some will also be done by Roz Wade, who is Education and Outreach Officer at the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge.</p>

					<p>We have already had extensive contacts with the community at Burnmouth, where Jenny Clack (Cambridge) gave a well-received talk in July 2011, when the village hall was packed and they had to ship in extra chairs.  This was followed up in 2014 when Dave Millward (BGS) gave an equally well-attended talk to bring the local community up-to-date.</p>

					<p>In November, 2012, Jenny spoke about the project to a good audience at the Geological Association Festival of Geology at University College London, and to the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society. In July, 2013, she had lots of very positive feedback when she spoke about the project at the 10th International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology in Barcelona.</p>
