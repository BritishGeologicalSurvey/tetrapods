					<p>The BGS Open Day on 28th September was a great success, with some 914 folk through the door. The TW:eed Project exhibit attracted quite a lot of interest from the more discerning visitors (though bigger crowds were to be seen at the nearby &lsquo;flour&rsquo; volcano display). We had a larger area than last year so we were able to display many of the posters prepared for the Symposium of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Comparative Anatomy in Edinburgh in August, including the East Kirkton one. One of my colleagues organised badge making for the younger kids using the Ribbo image and our website address. This went down very well, attracting many families with children.</p>
					<p>Because most of the good new tetrapod material is in Cambridge, NMS kindly lent us a couple of wonderful specimens from East Kirkton (<em>Silvanerpeton miripedes</em> and <em>Balonerpeton woodi</em>). These are fabulous specimens and caused a lot of interest &#150; so many thanks to NMS. The enormous <em>Gyracanthus</em> spine from Cambridge went down well too. My talk appears to have been well received with lots of questions at the end. We were delighted too that Maggie Wood and Oliver Kieran were able to come and chat to us during the day. I thoroughly enjoyed the day, though I was near to dropping at the end!</p>
