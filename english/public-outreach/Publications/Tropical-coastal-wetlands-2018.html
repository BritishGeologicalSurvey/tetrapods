					<p>I don't have the sedimentologial knowledge to write a layman's summary of this paper, so this is
					just the abstract, copied from the paper.  In the New Year, Dave Millward (BGS) will do that for me.
					This is just a placeholder for now.</p>

					<p>The Lower Carboniferous Ballagan Formation of northern Britain is one of only two successions
					worldwide to yield the earliest known tetrapods with terrestrial capability following the end-Devonian
					mass extinction event. Studies of the sedimentary environments and habitats in which these beasts
					lived have been an integral part of a major research project into how, why and under what circumstances
					this profound step in the evolution of life on Earth occurred. </p>

					<p>Here, a new palaeogeographic map is
					constructed from outcrop data integrated with new and archived borehole material. The map shows the
					extent of a very low-relief coastal wetland developed along the tropical southern continental margin.
					Coastal floodplains in the Midland Valley and Tweed basins were separated from the
					marginal marine seaway of the Northumberland-Solway Basin to the south by an archipelago of more
					elevated areas.</p>

					<p>A complex mosaic of sedimentary environments was juxtaposed, and included fresh and
					brackish to saline and hypersaline lakes, a diverse suite of floodplain palaeosols and a persistent
					river system in the east of the region. The strongly seasonal climate led to the formation of
					evaporite deposits alternating with flooding events, both meteoric and marine. </p>

					<p>Storm surges drove marine floods from the southwest into both the western Midland Valley and
					Northumberland-Solway Basin; marine water also flooded into the Tweed Basin and Tayside in the east. </p>

					<p>The Ballagan Formation is a rare example in the geological record of a tropical, seasonal coastal
					wetland that contains abundant, small-scale evaporite deposits. The diverse sedimentary environments
					and palaeosol types indicate a network of different terrestrial and aquatic habitats in which the
					tetrapods lived.</p>
