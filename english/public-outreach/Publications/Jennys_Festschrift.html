					<p>The current volume of <strong>Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of
					Edinburgh</strong> brings together a collection of research papers in celebration of Jenny&#39;s career
					and achievements.  The volume is entitled <strong>Fossils, Function and Phylogeny: Papers on Early
					Vertebrate Evolution in Honour of Professor Jennifer A. Clack</strong> and was edited by three of
					Jenny&#39;s colleagues, Marcello Ruta, Per Ahlberg and Tim Smithson.</p>

					<p>Research into this area has advanced considerably in the last few decades as the result of major fossil
					discoveries, the establishment of evolutionary developmental biology as a central discipline and
					technological advances in image data analysis. The 21 papers showcase the latest work on the anatomy,
					biomechanics, evolution, ecology and distribution of these creatures. In all these areas, Jenny has played
					an integral role. Notably, two papers result from work on the TW:eed Project.</p>

					<p>Commenting on the volume, Marcello said: &quot;This volume is a solid testament to Jenny&#39;s scholarly
					influence and transformative contributions to vertebrate palaeontology. Her research has reset our
					understanding of the emergence of tetrapods from fish, casting light on the transition from fins to limbs
					and the key modifications in hearing, feeding, breathing, and locomotory mechanisms.</p>

					<p>&quot;Jenny is a true polymath with a keen eye for anatomical detail, a natural thirst for knowledge, and an
					unsurpassed ability to challenge conventional wisdom through ground&#45;breaking and paradigm&#45;shifting
					discoveries.&quot;</p>

					<p>Per noted: &quot;Studies of early vertebrates benefit enormously from cross&#45;disciplinary approaches
					and technological innovations, especially in image data acquisition and processing. Several contributions
					to the volume combine traditional methods of fossil observation with advanced microcomputed tomographic
					scanning techniques for building 3D models of delicate fossil structures. As a result, it is now possible
					to make reliable inferences about the mode of development and even the size of the genome of extinct
					vertebrates.&quot;</p>

					<p>&quot;Jenny has embraced &#45; and often pioneered &#45; many of the innovative approaches to the study
					of fossil vertebrates that feature routinely in current publications in the field. Her scientific foresight
					is unique.&quot;</p>

					<p>Tim added: &quot;These are exciting times for anyone interested in the evolution of vertebrates. We hope
					that this volume will encourage the next generation of vertebrate palaeontologists to use these innovative
					approaches to add to our understanding of the interrelationships of major vertebrate groups, the links
					between structural, functional, and ecological innovations, and the origin of anatomical complexity.</p>

					<p>&quot;Jenny&#39;s work has had a major impact in all these areas but she would be the first to recognize
					that there is much yet to learn.&quot;</p>

					<p>The special issue <strong>Fossils, Function and Phylogeny: Papers on Early Vertebrate Evolution in Honour
					of Professor Jennifer A. Clack</strong> is available at:
					<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/earth-and-environmental-science-transactions-of-royal-society-of-edinburgh/issue/B7649DCA66911044B010241C00E8DA45" target="_blank">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/earth-and-environmental-science-transactions-of-royal-society-of-edinburgh/issue/B7649DCA66911044B010241C00E8DA45</a></p>

					<p>Sadly, there is some restriction to accessing this volume at the Cambridge Core  where it resides online, and
					most people will only be able to see the introductory page and the list of references.</p>
