					<p>We decided it would be nice to show you some of the places where we've been working, so I've put together a few pictures in a slide show. They're not presented in the order they were taken, more grouped by locality.</p>
					<p>All the sites where we've found fossils are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and require authorisation for collecting.</p>
					<p>As we've been collecting there for some years, all the personnel involved in the project are well known to the locals, who are justifiably proud of their heritage and keep their eyes open as they go about their business!</p>
