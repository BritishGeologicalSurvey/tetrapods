				<p><a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geology/people/davies-sj?searchterm=sarah%20davies" target="_blank">Sarah Davies </a>is Professor of Sedimentology at the University of Leicester. She has over 20 years experience and numerous publications in clastic sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy. In 2007 she received the <a href="http://www.bsrg.org.uk/" target="_blank">British Sedimentological Resesarch Group </a><a href="http://www.bsrg.org.uk/awards_research.html" target="_blank">Roland Goldring Award </a>for noteworthy published research in any field of sedimentology. She leads a research group which provides expertise in the fields of downhole logging, core petrophysics and core-log integration to the <a href="http://www.iodp.org/" target="_blank">Integrated Ocean Drilling Programm (IODP) </a>expeditions for the global research community.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geology/people/cbennett?searchterm=carys%20bennett" target="_blank">Carys Bennett </a>is interested in palaeoclimate and fossils, and is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracod" target="_blank">ostracod</a> specialist, with experience of Carboniferous sedimentology, macro- and micro-faunas, palynology and geochemistry. One of the main findings of a recent study of non-marine ostracods which she carried out was the potential use of ostracod shell geochemistry as a palaeoclimatic indicator.</p>
				<p>In the first year of the project, Carys has done extensive logging and sampling of the rocks of the Ballagan Formation, particularly at Burnmouth, but also at numerous other sites in the region.</p>
				<p class="clear"><strong>Janet Sherwin</strong></p>
				<div class="wp-caption alignleft col-140"><img class="size-full wp-image-272" src="/common/images/Janet-Shervin.jpg" alt="&copy; Copyright Rob Clack" title="Janet Sherwin" /> </div>
				<p><a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geology/people/sherwin-je?searchterm=sherwin" target="_blank">Janet Sherwin</a> uses optical and electron microscopy, and petrographic analysis to understand the processes of deposition, and depositional environments, particularly of fine-grained sediments.</p>
				<p>Janet is particularly interested in the sediments exposed at Coquetdale.  She is studying for an MPhil.</p>
				<p class="clear"><strong>Masters Students</strong></p>
				In academic year 2014-2015, three University of Leicester masters students, who have just completed the third year of their integrated masters degrees, will be working on projects as part of the TW:eed consortium research.
				</p>
				<p class="clear"><strong>Rachel Curtis</strong></p>
				<div class="wp-caption alignleft col-140"><img class="size-full wp-image-272" src="/common/images/Rachel-Curtis.jpg" alt="&copy; Copyright Carys Bennett" title="Rachel Curtis" /> </div>
				<p>Rachel Curtis is reading for a degree in Geology. Having spent time in the field with Carys as a field assistant in summer 2013, Rachel chose the Masters project on &ldquo;Early Carboniferous depositional environments in the Northumberland Basin and implications for carbon-isotope stratigraphy&rdquo; supervised by Sarah Davies, Dave Millward (BGS), Melanie Leng (NIGL) and Carys Bennett (UoL). This project will test the hypothesis that the Northumberland Basin was more marine-influenced than the neighbouring Tweed Basin. She was at the British Geological Survey studying the Hoddom borehole in June. Rachel will be combining sedimentology, with BGS palaeontological samples and internal BGS reports  and carbon-isotope stratigraphy.</p>
				<p class="clear"><strong>Hattie Dulson</strong></p>
				<div class="wp-caption alignleft col-140"><img src="/common/images/Hattie-Dulson.jpg" alt="&copy; Copyright Carys Bennett" title="Hattie Dulson" /> </div>
				<p>Hattie Dulson is reading for a degree in Geology with Palaeobiology. In her Masters year, Hattie will be working on a project entitled &ldquo;How variable were the Early Carboniferous ecosystems inhabited by the earliest four-limbed vertebrates?&rdquo;. Supervised by Sarah and Carys (UoL) this project will test the hypothesis that an interval with newly-discovered plant and tetrapod fossils represents a transition from a non-marine to a marine-influenced environment.</p>
				<p class="clear"><strong>Greg Phillpotts</strong></p>
				<div class="wp-caption alignleft col-140"><img class="size-full wp-image-272" src="/common/images/Greg-Phillpotts.jpg" alt="&copy; Copyright Carys Bennett" title="Greg Phillpotts" /> </div>
				<p>Greg Phillpotts is reading for a degree in Geology with Palaeobiology. In his Masters year, Greg will be working on a project entitled &ldquo;Why were the Early Carboniferous floodplains of southern Scotland key sites for preservation of the earliest four-limbed vertebrates?&rdquo; Supervised by Sarah and Carys (UoL) this project will test the hypothesis that a key interval with important early tetrapod fossils represents an entirely non-marine floodplain environment.</p>
				<p>Hattie and Greg spent a week in the field in July 2014. During that week, they each logged and sampled a ten-metre thick succession within the Burnmouth section. When they return in the Autumn for the new academic year, they will begin to process the rocks to look for microfossils. They will also have access to thin sections and carbon isotope data collected from their succession as part of the larger consortium project.</p>
