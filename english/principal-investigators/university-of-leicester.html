				<p><a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geology/people/davies-sj?searchterm=sarah%20davies" target="_blank">Sarah Davies </a>is Professor of Sedimentology at the University of Leicester. She has over 20 years experience and numerous publications in clastic sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy. In 2007 she received the <a href="http://www.bsrg.org.uk/" target="_blank">British Sedimentological Resesarch Group </a><a href="http://www.bsrg.org.uk/awards_research.html" target="_blank">Roland Goldring Award </a>for noteworthy published research in any field of sedimentology. She leads a research group which provides expertise in the fields of downhole logging, core petrophysics and core-log integration to the <a href="http://www.iodp.org/" target="_blank">Integrated Ocean Drilling Programm (IODP) </a>expeditions for the global research community.  In 2015, Sarah was awarded the <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/" target="_blank">Geological Society</a>'s Coke Medal for her exceptional contribution to geology.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geology/people/cbennett?searchterm=carys%20bennett" target="_blank">Carys Bennett </a>is interested in palaeoclimate and fossils, and is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracod" target="_blank">ostracod</a> specialist, with experience of Carboniferous sedimentology, macro- and micro-faunas, palynology and geochemistry. One of the main findings of a recent study of non-marine ostracods which she carried out was the potential use of ostracod shell geochemistry as a palaeoclimatic indicator.</p>
				<p>In the first year of the project, Carys has done extensive logging and sampling of the rocks of the Ballagan Formation, particularly at Burnmouth, but also at numerous other sites in the region.</p>

				<p class="clear"><strong>Janet Sherwin</strong></p>
				<div class="wp-caption alignleft col-140"><img class="size-full wp-image-272" src="/common/images/Janet-Shervin.jpg" alt="&copy; Copyright Rob Clack" title="Janet Sherwin" /> </div>
				<p><a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/geology/people/sherwin-je?searchterm=sherwin" target="_blank">Janet Sherwin</a> uses optical and electron microscopy, and petrographic analysis to understand the processes of deposition, and depositional environments, particularly of fine-grained sediments.</p>
				<p>Janet is particularly interested in the sediments exposed at Coquetdale.  She is studying for an MPhil.</p>

				<p class="clear"><strong>Masters Students</strong></p>
				In academic year 2015-2016, two University of Leicester masters students will be working on projects as part of the TW:eed consortium research.</p>

				<p class="clear"><strong>Hattie Dulson</strong></p>
				<div class="wp-caption alignleft col-140"><img src="/common/images/Hattie-Dulson.jpg" alt="&copy; Copyright Carys Bennett" title="Hattie Dulson" /> </div>
				<p>Hattie Dulson is reading for a degree in Geology with Palaeobiology. In her Masters year, Hattie will be working on a project entitled &ldquo;How variable were the Early Carboniferous ecosystems inhabited by the earliest four-limbed vertebrates?&rdquo;. Supervised by Sarah and Carys (UoL) this project will test the hypothesis that an interval with newly-discovered plant and tetrapod fossils represents a transition from a non-marine to a marine-influenced environment.</p>

				<p class="clear"><strong>Levi Curry</strong></p>
				<div class="wp-caption alignleft col-140"><img src="/common/images/Levi-Curry.jpg" alt="&copy; Copyright Carys Bennett" title="Levi Curry" /> </div>
				<p>Levi Curry is reading for a degree in Geology. In her Masters year Levi is working on the project entitled "Microfossils from the Ballagan Formation, Early Carboniferous: testing for changes in floodplain conditions through time." Supervised by Sarah Davies, Carys Bennett (University of Leicester), Tim Kearsey (BGS) and Tim Smithson (University of Cambridge), the project aims to examine the microfossil content of siltstones and cementstones throughout the Ballagan Formation and compare their different fossil assemblages. Levi will test the hypothesis that siltstones and their associated fauna reflect a non-marine paleoenvironment, representing deposition on the floodplain, contrasting with the fauna present within cementstones, which represent deposition in saline lakes to shallow marine environments. </p>

				<p>In July 2015 Levi was a volunteer on the excavation near Chirnside for a week, and completed a two-week microfossil summer placement with Carys in August 2015. This experience is a fantastic head start for Levi and she is already well versed in identifying Carboniferous microfossils.</p>
