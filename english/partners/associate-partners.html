					</div>
					<p>Maggie is Stan Wood's widow.  She sent me this text for her entry here.</p>
					<p>Stan&apos;s enthusiasm for palaeontology affected all who knew him. I was no exception and thoroughly enjoyed field trips, conferences and helping him with cataloguing, ever since we met in 2005.  It was so exciting for both my elderly father, Rowland, and me to be around while Stan was exploring, firstly at Whitrope Burn and then at Burnmouth and Chirnside, and to watch him slowly revealing the fossils hidden within the rocks, which slowly began to occupy every room in our house.</p>

					<p>After Stan died it was a great comfort to be able to continue as a volunteer member of the TW:eed team, albeit in a very minor capacity.  When Jenny [Clack] learned that I'd like to do more, she suggested that I might have an aptitude for fossil preparation, perhaps mindful that my working life was spent as an ophthalmologist performing delicate microsurgery.  I have now had some basic training in Cambridge and am working under the supervision of Vicen Carri&oacute; as a volunteer preparator at the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh.
