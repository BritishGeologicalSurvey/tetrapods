					<p><a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/about/keycontacts/neilclark/" target="_blank">Neil Clark</a> is Curator of Palaeontology at the Hunterian, University of Glasgow where he researches the collections. He has a wide range of interests including Scottish Middle Jurassic dinosaurs, crinoids, starfish, conodonts, coprolites and Carboniferous crustaceans. The Hunterian has <em>Pederpes finneyae</em> from Romer&#8217;s Gap in Dumbarton in its collections &#45; an animal that was researched by Jenny Clack and prepared by Sarah Finney for publication in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6893/full/nature00824.html">Nature in 2002</a> and elsewhere.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/lauren-sallan/" target="_blank">Lauren Sallan</a> is an Assistant Professor in Earth and Environmental Science and the Evolution Cluster at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research focuses on the drivers of macroevolutionary changes in early vertebrates and ray-finned fishes. Lauren previously discovered, and continues to study, the impact of the end-Devonian mass extinction on vertebrates and its connection with Romer&#8217;s Gap.</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/people?indv=3588" target="_blank">Tom Challands</a> is a research associate and teaching fellow at the University of Edinburgh. His research interests concern evolution of the Dipnoi (lungfish), in particular, the evolution of sensory functions in this group and closely related organisms.</p>

					</div>
					<p>Carla Bardua is a University of Cambridge undergraduate whose final year project involves micro-CT scanning some of our specimens and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation" target="_blank">segmenting</a> the results to give 3D images of specimens still largely enclosed in the rock.</p>

					<p>Maggie is Stan Wood's widow.  She sent me this text for her entry here.</p>
					<p>Stan&apos;s enthusiasm for palaeontology affected all who knew him. I was no exception and thoroughly enjoyed field trips, conferences and helping him with cataloguing, ever since we met in 2005.  It was so exciting for both my elderly father, Rowland, and me to be around while Stan was exploring, firstly at Whitrope Burn and then at Burnmouth and Chirnside, and to watch him slowly revealing the fossils hidden within the rocks, which slowly began to occupy every room in our house.</p>

					<p>After Stan died it was a great comfort to be able to continue as a volunteer member of the TW:eed team, albeit in a very minor capacity.  When Jenny [Clack] learned that I'd like to do more, she suggested that I might have an aptitude for fossil preparation, perhaps mindful that my working life was spent as an ophthalmologist performing delicate microsurgery.  I have now had some basic training in Cambridge and am working under the supervision of Vicen Carri&oacute; as a volunteer preparator at the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh.

					<p>In a previous life, Rob Clack was a computer programmer and technical author. He loves collecting fossils and has been on numerous collecting holidays with Jenny. He helps with preparation of fossils, created this website, which he has also translated in to Spanish, <a title="Downloads" href="http://www.theclacks.org.uk/jac/index.html" target="_blank">Jenny&#8217;s professional website</a> and the <a href="http://www.theclacks.org.uk/" target="_blank">Clacks family website</a>. He also maintains the project <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TWeedProject" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and also writes occasional <a title="Downloads" href="/downloads.html">newsletters </a>for the project.</p>
